## List Comprehension

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. The are created using square brackets that contain an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The list comprehension always returns a result list.

**Example:**

new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]

as opposed to:

new_list = []  
for i in old_list:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;if filter(i):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new_list.append(expressions(i))

### Basic Syntax

[ expression for item in list if conditional ]

The above list comprehension is equivalent to:

for item in list:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;if conditional:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expression

### Creating a simple list

x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x

**output:**
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 

### Create a list using loops and list comprehension

*You can either use loops:*
squares = []

for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)
 
print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

*Or you can use list comprehensions to get the same result:*
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
