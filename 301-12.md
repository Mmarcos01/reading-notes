### Differences

**SQL**  
- Databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS)  
- Table based (represent data in form of tables, consisting of rows)  
- Have predefined schema  
- Vertically scalable  
- Uses SQL ( structured query language )

**NoSQL**  
- Databases are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database  
- Document based (collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases...)  
- Have dynamic schema for unstructured data  
- Horizontally scalable  
- Queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). UnQL syntax varies from database to database.


## Questions

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? Give a real world example.**  

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment and high transactional applications.  
(MySQL, Oracle, Sqlite)  

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? Give a real world example.**  
NoSQL databases fit better for hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (big data).  
(MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis)  

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**  
NoSQL  

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**  
SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.  

**What does SQL stand for?**  
Structured Query Language

**What is a relational database?**  
A type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**  
Tables

**What is a 'schema'?**  
The organization of data, how the database is constructed, using rows of 'fields', all records have to follow the schema

**What is a NoSQL database?**  
Non-structured Query Language

**How does it work?**  
Documents within Collections within database

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**  
NoSQL database, stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**  
MongoDB, dynamic schema

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**  
Not as mature as SQL
