## Markdown
This site was made in GitHub using the coding language Markdown.
Markdown uses symple syntax and is an easy way to make writing on the internet look good. With just a few extra characters you can stylize your text and add heirarchy to your page.

### Here's a small sample of what you can do with markdown:

**Syntax** | **Effect**
------ | ------
using one # before a title | Creates a large header
using ** before and after text | **Makes text bold**
using * before and after text | *Makes text italicized*
