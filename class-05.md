## HTML Images

When adding images to your site it is good practice to keep them in their own images folder. Images should, be relevant, convey information, mood, and fit the color palette.

\<img> - is the image tag that carries the attributes of:
  - src - tells the browser where it can find the image
  - alt - provides text description of the image if you can't see it
  - title - provides additional information about the image, some browsers will show when the user hovers over the image
  - height - specifies height
  - width - specifies width  

  > The align attribute has been removed from HTML5, but can still be come across in older code.
