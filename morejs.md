### More on Operators

Boolean: true or false

**==** means is equal to, it compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same

- 'Hello' = 'Goodbye' returns false
- 'Hello' = 'Hello' returns true

**===** is a more strict method of equal to, this operator compares two values to check that both the *data type and value* are the same.

- '3' === 3 returns false
- '3' === '3' returns true

**!=** means is not equal to, compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are *not* the same.

- 'Hello' != 'Goodbye' returns true
- 'Hello' != 'Hello' returns true

**!==** is the more strict method, compares two values to check that both the *data type and value* are *not* the same.

- '3' !== 3 returns true
- '3' !== '3' returns false

> Programmers refer to the testing or checking of a condition as **evaluating** the condition.

Conditions can be complex and usually result in a value of true or false. With a few exceptions. (p 157, 167)

**>** greater than, checks if the number on the left is *greater* than the number on the right.

- 4 > 3 returns true
- 3 > 4 returns false

**>=** greater than or equal to

**<** Less than

**<=** less than or equal to
