### More on Operators

Boolean: true or false

**==** means is equal to, it compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same

'Hello' = 'Goodbye' returns false
'Hello' = 'Hello' returns true

**===** is a more strict method of equal to, this operator compares two values to check that both the *data type and value* are the same.

'3' === 3 returns false
'3' === '3' returns true

**!=** means is not equal to, compares two values (numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are *not* the same.

'Hello' != 'Goodbye' returns true
'Hello' != 'Hello' returns true

**!==** is the more strict method, compares two values to check that both the *data type and value* are *not* the same.

'3' !== 3 returns true
'3' !== '3' returns false

> Programmers refer to the testing or checking of a condition as **evaluating** the condition.
