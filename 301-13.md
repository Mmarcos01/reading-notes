## Questions 
Describe what each group of status code represents:  
100’s = Info  
200’s = Success  
300’s = Redirect  
400’s = Error  
500’s = ServerError  

**What is a status code 202?**  
Accepted  
**What is a status code 308?**  
Permanent Redirect  
**What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?**  
400  
**What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?**  
307  
**What is the 'Forbidden' status code?**  
403 

## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

> Understanding the class a status code is in, helps locate problems more quickly.

**100 - 199**  
Informational status codes.  

**200 - 299**  
Success codes.  

**300 - 399**  
Redirection codes.  

**400 - 499**  
Client error codes.  

**500 - 599**  
Server error codes.  

## CRUD

Create, Read, Update, Delete  

The CRUD model defines the most basic API actions for persistent storage.

### CREATE

The create action is usually implemented from HTTPs POST method.  

**Status Codes**  
**200 OK** -  tells the client everything went well  
**201 Created** - Create operations, signals backend-side resource creation  
**202 Accepted** - Often used for asynchronous processing, tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing  
**303 See Other** - Like the 202 code but using a Location header field in response to inform the client about the location of the created resource  

### READ

The read action gets implemented via HTTPs GET method and used to fetch resource representations.  

**Status Codes**  
**200 OK** - tells the client everything went well  
**206 Partial Content** - useful for lists of content that are too big to be delivered in one response  
**300 Multiple Choices** - used if there are multiple representations for one resource and the client has to choose one of them  
**308 Permanent Redirect** -  tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current anymore  
**304 Not Modified** - Is used like 200 but without a body, so the client will be redirected to its locally cached representation from a previous read  
**307 Temporary Redirect** - When the URL to a resource could change in the future  

### UPDATE
An update can be implemented with an HTTP PUT or PATCH method. 

**PUT** requires the client to send an entire representation of a resource to update it.  
**PATCH** requires the client only send parts of the representation of the resource to update it.  

**Status Codes**
**200 OK** - tells the client everything went well  
**204 No Content** - updates that don’t return data to the client  
**202 Accepted** - if update is done asynchronous, this code can be used  

### DELETE
The delete action can be implemented with the HTTP DELETE method.

**Status Codes**
**200 OK** - Some people think a delete function of any kind should return the deleted element, so a representation of the deleted element can be included in the response body  
**204 No Content** - status code for this case, as the resource has been deleted  
**202 Accepted** - If the deletion is asynchronous and takes some time, return this code with some information or URL to tell the client when it will be deleted  

### API Changes
If our API lives long enough, sooner or later it will change its structure. It’s best practice to avoid breaking changes and the redirection class of status codes can help with this because some clients follow their Location header automatically.

**Status Codes**
**307 Temporary Redirect** - code if the resource could be available on a different URL in the future  
**308 Permanent Redirect** -  if the resource will now be available at a new URL and the client should directly access it via the new URL in the future
