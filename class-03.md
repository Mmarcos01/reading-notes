## HTML Lists

There are three different types of html lists:  
  1. Ordered - a numbered list
  1. Unordered - a list containing symbols other than numbers, such as bullet points
  1. Definition lists - made of terms along with the definition of each  

  ### List Elements:  

 \</ol> - ordered list
 \</ul> - unordered list
 \</li> - list item

 \<dl> - definition list
 \<dt> - contains the term to be defined
 \<dd> - containts definition of the term

> You can put another list inside an li element to create a nested or sub-list.

## Boxes

The term 'box model' is used in CSS regarding design and layout. In HTML all elements can be considered boxes. We can use CSS to then edit these boxes and manipulate spacing between elements.  

Creating a border around your boxes is a good way to see how your boxes are set up on the page.
