## HTML Lists

There are three different types of html lists:  
  1. Ordered - a numbered list
  1. Unordered - a list containing symbols other than numbers, such as bullet points
  1. Definition lists - made of terms along with the definition of each  

  ### List Elements:  

 \</ol> - ordered list
 \</ul> - unordered list
 \</li> - list item

 \<dl> - definition list
 \<dt> - contains the term to be defined
 \<dd> - containts definition of the term

> You can put another list inside an li element to create a nested or sub-list.

## Boxes

The term 'box model' is used in CSS regarding design and layout. In HTML all elements can be considered boxes. We can use CSS to then edit these boxes and manipulate spacing between elements.  

Creating a border around your boxes is a good way to see how your boxes are set up on the page.

## Javascript Decisions and Loops

**Switch Statements** start with a variable called the switch value and performs different actions based on different conditions.  

switch (value){
}  

**Type Coercion** - Javascript can convert data types to complete an operation, such as string '1' to number 1. Type coercion can lead to unexpected errors, therefore it is beter to use operators such as === and !== as opposed to == and !=

  - weak typing - Javascript uses weak typing because data types can change
  - strong typing - some languages have the requirement to specify which data type a variable will be  

### Truthy and Falsy Values  

> Due to type coercion, every value in Javascript can be treated as true or false.

**Falsy** - values treated as if they are false or 0
**Truthy** - values treated as if they are true or 1
**Unary Operator** - returns a result with just one operand.
