## Forms

>HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

## Controlled Components 

In HTML, form elements typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, state is typically updated with setState().  

We can combine the two by making the React state be the "single source of truth". Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a "controlled component".

## The textarea Tag

In HTML, a \<textarea> element defines its text by its children:  

\<textarea>  
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area  
\</textarea>  

In React, \<textarea> uses a value attribute. This way, a form using a \<textarea> can be written similarly to a form that uses a single-line input.

## The select Tag

In HTML, <select> creates a drop-down list. For example:  

\<select>  
  \<option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit\</option>  
  \<option value="lime">Lime\</option>  
  \<option selected value="coconut">Coconut\</option>  
  \<option value="mango">Mango\</option>  
\</select>  

The Coconut option is initially selected, because of the selected attribute.  

React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag that only needs to be updated in one place.  

### Note
>You can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag: \<select multiple={true} value={['B', 'C']}>

## The file input Tag

In HTML, an \<input type="file"> lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage.  

Because its value is read-only, it is an uncontrolled component in React.

## Handling Multiple Inputs

>When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.

## Controlled Input Null Value

Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you intend it. If you've specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null.

## Alternatives to Controlled Components

Difficulties may arise when converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations; check out uncontrolled components- an alternative technique for implementing input forms:

## Fully-Fledged Solutions

[Formik](https://formik.org/)  

Formik is one of the most popular open source form library for React and React Native. (However, it is built on the same principles of controlled components and managing state — so don’t neglect to learn them.)
