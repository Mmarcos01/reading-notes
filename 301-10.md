## The JavaScript Call Stack
> The JavaScript engine is a single-threaded interpreter comprising of a heap and a single call stack.  

The call stack is used primarily to invoke functions (call). The call stack is synchronous, execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom.  

>At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).  

**LIFO** - the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to pop out when the function returns  

> When a function is invoked, the function, parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame(a memory location in the stack). The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is popped out of the stack.  

### Stack Overflow
> A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function without an exit point. The browser has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.  

### Call Stack Key Takeaways:
1. It is single-threaded (can only do one thing at a time).
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. Last In, First Out data structure.

## Types of Error Messages
 Much of developer work consists of reading and debugging code. Being able to read and handle errors, as well as use your tools properly is essential to you as a developer. 

**Reference errors** - trying to use an undeclared variable  
**Syntax errors** - incorrect syntax  
**Range errors** - trying to manipulate an object and give it an invalid length  
**Type errors** - trying to access incompatible types  

## Debugging

**Tools:**
 - console.log  
 - chrome developer tools  
 - debugger statement
