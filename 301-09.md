## Functional Programming
What is it?  

>Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia  

### Pure Function
A pure function - returns the same result if given the same arguments and
It does not cause any observable side effects.  

**Benefits:**
Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. The code’s easier to test. 

### Immutability
>When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

### Referential Transparency
>If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

>**pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency**
