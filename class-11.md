## Images
You can control images sizes by resizing them manually with a picture editing program, otherwise it can be done in CSS. As for achieving alignment of images, there are two ways it is commonly achieved:  

1. Float the class that was created to represent the size of the image
1. Create new classes with names such as align-left or align-right  

Centering images in CSS:  

1. On the containing element use text-align: center;
2. On the image itself, use margin: auto;  

Background Images:  
The background-repeat property can have four values:  
repeat - repeats horizontally and vertically
repeat-x - repeats horizontally only
repeat-y - repeats vertically only
no-repeat - only one image  

The background-attachment property can have two values:  

fixed - image stays in same position on the page
scroll - image moves up and down as user scrolls  

The background-position property specifies where in the browser window the image should be placed.  

Background property order:
1. background-color
1. background-image
1. background-repreat
1. background-attachment
1. background-position
