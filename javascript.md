## JavaScript

JavaScript is the behavior layer and provides **logic** and interactivity to your webpage. It can **access** content by selecting any element, attribute, or text in html. It can **modify** content by adding or removing elements, attributes, or text. With JavaScript you can specify rules for the browser to follow and have the script react to certain events, such as when the user clicks a button or hovers over an image.


### Objects and Methods

**Object** -containers for named values called properties or methods.
**Methods** -are actions that can be performed on objects.

### Script

A script is a series of instructions for the computer to follow and each instruction should start on a new line, each instruction is known as a **statement.** Statments end with a semicolon.

Statements can be organized into **code blocks** (areas surrounded by curly braces) Code blocks can be used to group together many more statements.

The <*script*> element is used with embed JavaScript code.

*Remember JavaScript is case sensitive*
