# Welcome to My Notes

Hello, my name is Marie Marcos and I'm from the beautiful state of Washington. I'm a former Aviation Electrician for the US Navy and am now following the path to greater technical knowledge by learning to code. This is the beginning of my journey!

In this webpage, I'm utilizing a lightweight markup language called Markdown to create formatted and organized notes on all the awesome things I've been learning about.
