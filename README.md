# Welcome to my First GitHub Webpage

Where I will talk about having growth mindset!

## What does it mean to have Growth Mindset?
Growth Mindset is to be open to learn and try new things, even with the fear of failure. Try, fail, **Try again.**

### **Keeping in the Growth Mindset**
- Think of the better future!
- Get some exercise to clear your head and stir motivation.
- Ask for help, cause you're going to need it.
