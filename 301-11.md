[Authorization and Authentication flows](https://auth0.com/docs/flows)

## Authentication and Authorization
Often used interchangeably, authentication and authorization represent fundamentally different functions.

**Authentication**  
  - proving you are who you say you are  
  - login  
  - proof  


**Authorization**   
  - allowing the user to do something  
  - access limits  

## OAuth
OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework, it allows websites and services to share assets among users. In short, it is a general framework for login cross providers (think logging in with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn ect)  

## Auth0
Auth0 - one specific tool that implements OAuth

> It can be helpful to remember that OAuth scenarios almost always represent two unrelated sites or services trying to accomplish something on behalf of users or their software. All three have to work together involving multiple approvals for the completed transaction to get authorized.  


### How OAuth Works
1. The first website connects to the second website  
1. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.  
1. The first site gives this token and secret to the userâ€™s client software.  
1. The client's software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider.  
1. The client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.  
1. The user approves (or their software approves) transaction at the first website.  
1. The user is given an approved access token.  
1. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.  
1. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication.  
1. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.  
1. The user sees a successfully completed transaction.
