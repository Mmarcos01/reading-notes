## Lifting State Up

When several components need to reflect the same changing data- it is reccomended to lift the shared state up to their closest ancestor. Refer to examples [Resource](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)  

>"Lifting state up" - In react, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. 

"Source of truth" - the component that owns the shared state, owner of shared state can set the rules.  

>There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application.  

You can use React Developer Tools to inspect the props and move up the tree until you find the component responsible for updating the state. This allows you trace the bugs to their source.

From example: Props are read-only. When the temperature was in the local state, the TemperatureInput could just call this.setState() to change it. However, now that the temperature is coming from the parent as a prop, the TemperatureInput has no control over it.  

In React, this is usually solved by making a component “controlled”. Just like the DOM \<input> accepts both a value and an onChange prop, so can the custom TemperatureInput accept both temperature and onTemperatureChange props from its parent Calculator.  

Now, when the TemperatureInput wants to update its temperature, it calls this.props.onTemperatureChange.  

## Lists and Keys

[Resource](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)  
In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical to using the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values- we assign the new array returned by map() to the variable 'doubled' and log it.  

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);  
console.log(doubled);

## JavaScript Spread Operator

[Resource](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)  

>The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.
