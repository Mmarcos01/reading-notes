# React

React is a JavaScript library used to simplify the process of making interactive UI's

Syntax such as the below is called JSX, a syntax extension of JavaScript. JSX produces React "elements."  
const element = \<h1>Hello, world!\</h1>;  

> Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. React doesn’t require using JSX, but it is helpful as a visual aid.

You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. You can also use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.  

Quotes can be used to specify string literals as attributes and curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute.  

React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names. Ex: class becomes className in JSX. By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them.

## Rendering Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps and describe what you want seen on screen. Elements are not the same as components, elements are what components are “made of”.  

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():  

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates are necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

## Components and Props

> Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

Components are like JavaScript functions that accept inputs called “props” (properties) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen. Component names should start with a capital letter and must never modify its own props.
