## What does it mean to have Growth Mindset?
Growth Mindset is to be open to learn and try new things, even with the fear of failure. Know that your abilities can continue to develop through persistence and dedication, even when things get tough. Accept critisism as it is offered and use it to grow. Try, fail, **Try again.**

### **Keeping in the Growth Mindset**
- Think of the better future!
- Ask for help, and use your resources. You will undoubtedly get stuck at times, it's ok to move on and revisit the issue later.
- Step away from the computer. Nature is energizing. Get some exercise to clear your head and stir motivation.
