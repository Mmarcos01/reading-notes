## What is Node.js?

Created by Ryan Dahl. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.  

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome (and Chromium browsers such as Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi). It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.  

Ryan Dahl took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.  

>This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

## Installing Node.js

You can go to the official Node download page and get the Node binaries for your system. Or use a version manager.  

A version manager is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. Advantages: it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis.  

You can check that Node is installed on your system by typing node -v into your terminal. You should see something like v12.14.1 displayed.  

Create a new file named hello.js and copy in the following code:  

console.log("Hello, World!");  
This uses Node’s built-in console module to display a message in a terminal window. To run the example, enter the following command:  

node hello.js  

If Node.js is configured properly, "Hello, World!" will be displayed.  

## Compatibility Table

[Node.js Compatibility](https://node.green/)  

 Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. You don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues.

 ## Introducing npm

 Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check the version type npm -v. Npm is also the world's largest software registry with over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download.

Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server and is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration, for building APIs, or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded.  

Advantages of Node.js are speed and scalability. You can do everything in the same language, increasing productivity. For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.
