## Thinking in React

### Start With A Mock

**Step 1:** Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy:  

Draw boxes around every component and give them names, if the designer has not already done so.  

To know what should be its own component, one technique to use is the **single responsibility principle**, that is, a component should ideally do only one thing. If it ends up getting bigger, it should be divided into smaller subcomponents. 


**Step 2:** Build A Static Version in React:  

The easiest way to implement your app is to build a version that renders the UI but has no interactivity. Building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.  

Build top-down or bottom-up, either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy or with the ones lower in it.

>It’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.  

**Step 3:** Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State:  

First think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. 

>Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand.  

**Step 4:** Identify Where Your State Should Live:  

Once the minimal set of app state has been identified. The next step is to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.  

>Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state, follow these steps to figure it out:  

**For each piece of state in your application:**  

 - Identify every component that renders something based on that state.  

 - Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).  

 - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.  

 - If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.  

 **Step 5:** Add Inverse Data Flow:  

 Support data flowing the other way. For example: We want to make sure that whenever the user changes a form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components can should only update their own state, they will pass callbacks that will fire whenever the state should be updated.
