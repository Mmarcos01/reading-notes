# Text Editors

Every coder will need a text editor in order to write their code, which one they chose is up their preference but not all editors may be as helpful to the user as others.

There are default text editors on all computers. On my windows laptop I have access to the editor called Notepad, in it I can code in plain text. However, Notepad lacks features. Feautures such as the ability to change to a theme with colors that are easier on the eyes, or have syntax highlighting and code completion suggestions, all feautures that could make work a little easier. Therefore, it would be beneficial for software developers to be midful of their choice of text editors available.
