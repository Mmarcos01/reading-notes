# ES6 Classes
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)  

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) was the second major revision to JavaScript.

Classes are a template for creating objects. In JavaScript classes are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 (the first major revision to JavaScript) class-like semantics.  

Classes are special functions that consist of two components: class expressions and class declarations. To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class.

## Hoisting

It is important to remember that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not. The class must be declared, then accessed, otherwise a ReferenceError will occur. (The ReferenceError object represents an error when a non-existent variable is referenced.)

## Class Expressions

Class expressions is another way to define a class- these can be named or unnamed. The name given to the named class expression is local to the class's body. Hoisting restrictions apply to class expressions.
