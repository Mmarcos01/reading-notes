[What is REST](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest#:~:text=REST%2C%20or%20REpresentational%20State%20Transfer,to%20communicate%20with%20each%20other.)

# REST

Roy Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.  

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called "REST". REST, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.  

 REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the concerns of client and server.

## HTTP Verbs  

There are 4 basic HTTP verbs we use in requests to interact with resources in a REST system:  

GET — retrieve a specific resource (by id) or a collection of resources
POST — create a new resource
PUT — update a specific resource (by id)
DELETE — remove a specific resource by id

## Status Codes

| 200 | (OK) |	This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests. |
| 201 | (CREATED)	| This is the standard response for an HTTP request that resulted in an item being successfully created. |
| 204 | (NO CONTENT) |	This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests, where nothing is being returned in the response body. |
| 400 | (BAD REQUEST) |	The request cannot be processed because of bad request syntax, excessive size, or another client error. |
| 403 | (FORBIDDEN) |	The client does not have permission to access this resource. |
| 404 | (NOT FOUND) |	The resource could not be found at this time. It is possible it was deleted, or does not exist yet. |
| 500 | (INTERNAL SERVER ERROR) |	The generic answer for an unexpected failure if there is no more specific information available. |
